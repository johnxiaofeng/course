This is the 2nd project of Term 1, using Convolutional Neural Network to recognize traffic signs. The data set used in
this project is the [German Traffic Sign data](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The details of the project can be found in the [write up](./writeup.pdf). The source codes are organized in the [jupyter notebook
file](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).
